To be honest, Practical 6 was quite difficult for me.
I even don't had any clues at the beginning of this practical, and I had to ask for help from my classmates.
Fortunately, I finally finished this task after a-long-time struggling.
Through this practical, my most important harvest is trying to intergrate many knowledges we have ever learnt and put them into visuial graphs.
Even if there were confusion, I try to find out the answers by myself but not just obtain answers form teachers.
It is truly a useful oppotunity for me to improve my programming skill.
However, I still need some time to "digest" these knowledges.
