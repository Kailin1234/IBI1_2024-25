This is an example file for reflection in IBI1_2024-25.

During this course(Practical3), I have learnt version control, how to navigate Unix-like systems and how to write simple programs in Python.

I have also learnt to write careful instructions when communicating online!

As far as I am concerned, lines above are really correct and I truly have learnt many things about GitHub.

However, this process is not smooth at all, which is paid for 2 days to finish!

To be honest, this process is challenging and painful, however, it works!

Addtionally, I am confused that my default branch is called main, not master, and I find one of my classmates also met this question and we are both Windows users.

Maybe it is because of operating systems?
